# Book Recommendation System with Collaborative Filtering

This project demonstrates how to build a book recommendation system using collaborative filtering. The system recommends books based on user ratings and computes similarities between books using cosine similarity.

## Features
- **Dataset**: Uses book metadata and user ratings.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends books based on user preferences.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures similarity between books based on user ratings.
- **Custom Recommendations**: Allows users to get recommendations for any book in the dataset.

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset:
   - [Book Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset)
2. Place the dataset files (`books.csv` and `ratings.csv`) in the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - scikit-learn
4. Run the script:
